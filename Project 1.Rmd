## Project 1

My goal is to import the log of Chess matches and calculate updated ELO scores for the players.

```{r Import}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

# First I'll read in the Chess txt file that I placed on Github.
# I want to note that each data point is separated by four spaces.
# I still need to change the import so that it's coming from Github and not my local machine.
chesstxt <- "Chess.txt"
(chess <- read_table(chesstxt,skip = 10))
colnames(chess)
view(chess)
