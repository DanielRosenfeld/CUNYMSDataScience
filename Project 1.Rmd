```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Project 1

My goal is to import the log of Chess matches and calculate updated ELO scores for the players.

```{r Import}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

# First I'll read in the Chess txt file that I placed on Github.
# I want to note that each data point is separated by four spaces.
chesstxt <- "Chess.txt"
(chess <- read_table(chesstxt,skip = 10))
colnames(chess)
view(chess)



?read_table()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
